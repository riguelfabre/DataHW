```{r Add two vector with loops}
v1 <- c(1,2,3)
v2 <- c(-1,-2,-3)
v3 <- c()
for(i in 1:3)
  {
  v3 <- c(v3,v1[i]+v2[i])
  
  }
v3
  
```
Vector Addition is much faster than looping because in vector addition, all the items in the vector get operated on at the same. While in a loop each item is operated on one at a time. 



```{r Heads in a row }

  flips <-c("head","head","head","tail","head")
i<-1
counter <- 0
while(flips[i] != "tail")
  {
  
 counter <- counter+1
  i <- i+1
 if(flips[i] == "tail")
  break
   
  
  
  }
(counter)
  
  
```






```{r add only the odd numbers }
total <-0
for (i in 1:100)
{
  
  ifelse(i%%2==1, total<-total+i, total<-total)
  
}
total

```

```{r Bonus }

sumofodd<-sum((1:50)*2 - 1)
sumofodd


```
